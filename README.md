## Installation

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 14 or higher

```bash
npm install
```

## Quick Start

**Recommended:** Run the combined scraper to get everything in one file:

```bash
npm run all
```

This creates a single Excel file with:
- 📊 "New Equipment" sheet (511 products)

```bash
# 1. Scrape all equipment data (~12 minutes)
npm run all

# 2. Generate interactive heat map (instant)
npm run analyze

# 3. Open the map in your browser
open docs/akrs-location-heatmap.html
```

**Result:** Excel file with 1,455 products + interactive map showing geographic distribution!

- **Auto-pagination:** Handles all pages automatically
- **Progress logging:** Real-time progress updates with location and hours
- **Error handling:** Continues on errors, saves partial results
- **Smart retries:** Handles timeouts and network issues gracefully

## How It Works

### Scraping Process

1. **Fetch Product Listings**
   - Scrapes product grid pages with pagination
   - Extracts: name, brand, model, year, price, category, images
   - Processes 12 products per page

2. **Fetch Product Details (Parallel)**
   - Visits each product's detail page
   - Extracts: location, hours (for used equipment)
   - Processes 10 products concurrently for speed

3. **Generate Excel File**
   - Formats data into professional spreadsheet
   - Adds auto-filters and frozen headers
   - Creates clickable URLs
   - Applies John Deere green styling

### Data Sources

- **Product listings:** Grid view on category pages
- **Location data:** Individual product detail pages
- **Hours data:** Individual product detail pages (used equipment only)

### Technical Stack

- **axios:** HTTP requests
- **cheerio:** HTML parsing (jQuery-like selectors)
- **exceljs:** Excel file generation
- **Node.js:** Runtime environment

## Technical Details

- **Batch size:** 10 products processed concurrently
- **Page delay:** 2 seconds between listing pages
- **Batch delay:** 500ms between detail page batches
- **Timeout:** 10 seconds per product detail page
- **Retry logic:** Continues on individual failures
- **Debug files:** Saves first page HTML for troubleshooting (auto-cleaned after successful completion)

## Heat Map Visualization

The location analyzer creates an interactive map showing equipment distribution:

**Output Location:** All heat maps are saved to the `docs/` directory for better organization (and GitHub Pages compatibility).

**Data Timestamp:** The map UI displays the source Excel filename and the date/time when the data was originally scraped (extracted from the filename timestamp), so you always know how current your data is.

### Features

**Interactive Map**
- 🔘 **Filter Toggle:** Switch between All/New/Used equipment
- Pan and zoom across Nebraska
- Click markers to see detailed stats
- Circle size = inventory quantity (scales to current filter)
- Circle color = inventory level (red=high, orange=medium, green=low)
- Markers update dynamically when filter changes

**Sidebar Statistics**
- Total products across all locations
- New vs. Used equipment breakdown
- Number of active locations
- Ranked list of locations (click to zoom)

**Visual Legend**
- 🔴 Red circles: High inventory (50+ products)
- 🟠 Orange circles: Medium inventory (20-49 products)
- 🟢 Green circles: Low inventory (1-19 products)

### Map Coordinates

All 27 AKRS locations are pre-mapped with accurate GPS coordinates:
- 26 locations in Nebraska
- 1 location in Kansas (OBERLIN)

### Workflow

```bash
# 1. Scrape data
npm run all

# 2. Generate heat map
npm run analyze

# 3. Open in browser
open docs/akrs-location-heatmap.html
```

The analyzer automatically finds and uses your most recent Excel file.

## Use Cases

### Inventory Analysis
- Compare new vs. used equipment availability
- Analyze pricing across locations
- Track equipment by model and year

### Market Research
- Identify popular models by location
- Compare hours on used equipment
- Monitor inventory levels over time

### Sales & Purchasing
- Find specific equipment by location
- Filter by price range or year
- Quickly access product pages via clickable URLs

### Data Export
- Import into databases or CRM systems
- Create custom reports and dashboards
- Share equipment lists with team members

### Geographic Analysis
- Visualize equipment distribution across Nebraska
- Identify high-inventory and low-inventory locations
- Optimize logistics and delivery routes
- Plan territory assignments for sales teams

## Notes

- 🌐 Data is scraped from public product listings
- ⏱️ All data is current as of scraping time
- 🔗 Excel files include clickable URLs for easy access
- 🤝 Scripts use respectful delays (not aggressive)
- 💾 Partial results are saved if errors occur

## Troubleshooting

### No Products Found
1. Check `debug-*.html` files (created on first page, auto-deleted after success)
2. If scraper fails, debug files remain for inspection
3. Website structure may have changed - update CSS selectors
4. Verify network connectivity to https://www.akrs.com

### Slow Performance
1. Check your internet connection speed
2. AKRS server may be slow - delays are intentional
3. Consider running during off-peak hours

### Missing Location Data
1. Some products may not have location published
2. Check individual product URLs manually
3. Location data comes from product detail pages

### Script Crashes
1. Check Node.js version (requires 14+)
2. Reinstall dependencies: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
3. Check for network timeouts (script continues on errors)
